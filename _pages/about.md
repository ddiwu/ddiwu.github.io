Welcome Here!

I am Di Wu, an undergraduate in University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). Last year, I did some research about SerDes supervised by [Prof. Lei Zhao](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~zlei/). 

Next semester, I will go to NUS in singpore to have a summer internship supervised by [Prof. He](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/) and [Prof. Chen](https://www.yaochen.site).

I will receive my B.S. degree in 2025. And my research interests include VLSI and computer architecture.
